# Lord of the Rings Archery

## Background

The **"Lord of the Rings Archery"** game is inspired by the legendary fantasy epic, *The Lord of the Rings* by **J.R.R. Tolkien**. Set in Middle-Earth, the game lets players embody the courage of iconic heroes of the Fellowship, **Legolas the Elf** and **Gimli the Dwarf**, as they stand against overwhelming forces in the defense of Middle-Earth.

Processing with Python is used to build the game's immersive environment and dynamic gameplay, capturing the essence of epic sieges from Tolkien's world. This project aims to merge classic gaming with the timeless themes of bravery and friendship showcased in *The Lord of the Rings*.

## Storyline

In **"Lord of the Rings Archery"**, players join the Fellowship of the Ring in their final battles against Sauron's forces. The storyline unfolds across three iconic battlefields:

- **Helm's Deep**: The game begins at Helm's Deep, where the heroes defend the fortress that witnessed Helm Hammerhand's stand in ages past against the relentless assault of the orc army. As Legolas or Gimli, players must use their archery skills to fend off waves of enemies that threaten to break through the fortress defenses.

- **Minas Tirith**: After defending Helm's Deep, players journey to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondorâ€”the "Tower of the Sun" facing its demise as the "Tower of Guard"â€”which stands as the last stronghold of men against Sauron's dark forces. In a desperate battle, the player must once again take up arms to shield the people of Gondor and prevent the fall of the White Tower.

- **The Black Gate**: In the climactic battle, players arrive at the Black Gate of Mordor, the final gateway to Sauronâ€™s domain. With the fate of Middle-Earth hanging in the balance, players must take a stand and face the most challenging waves of enemies. Victory here means survival, for Frodo and Sam must succeed in the very depths of Orodruin.

Each level introduces players to different enemy types and intensifies in difficulty, reflecting the rising stakes and epic scale of the battles.
